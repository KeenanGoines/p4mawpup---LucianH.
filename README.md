Follow these instructions: 
First make sure Python 2.7.14 is installed 
Next download Anaconda , 32/64 depending on OS 
Create and open an virtual enviorment by entering in the command terminal c:\Python27\Scripts\virtualenv -p c:\Python27\python.exe .lpvenv
then activate the virtualenv by entering .lpvenv\Scripts\activate 
Open CMD and type "pip install bs4"
Now inside the virtual env type "python" hit enter and the python's idle command prompt should appear.
Note: this is to test every line to make sure that it works first. 
Open a new editor file in your editor of choice i.e. notepad ++
Set the notepad ++ language to python and also go into prefrences and then languages and change the tab options to 4 spaces not the default.
Now Copy and paste the following code into the new file and save as a .py file inside of your .lpvenv/Scripts

Once that's complete, run the .py file under the virtual env directory or in the python idle command prompt as "python file_name.py"
